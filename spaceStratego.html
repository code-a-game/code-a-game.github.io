                            <p>Jeg har lavet følgende online multiplayer spil: <a href="https://friday-fun.github.io/"
                                    target="_blank">https://friday-fun.github.io/</a></p>

                            <p> Når du har valgt "START NEW GAME", så skal du paste url'en ind i et andet browser vindue
                                for at
                                starte spillet. Herefter bør du se nedenstående skærm. Her skal du skrive dit navn og
                                vælge
                                grønt
                                eller lilla hold.</p>

                            <p>Du kan lige prøve spillet, så du kender funktionaliteten. Man skal være flere spillere
                                for at
                                spille
                                det. Man kan dog godt åbne spillet i to forskellige browser vinduer og hermed have to
                                spillere.
                                De
                                to browser vinduer må dog ikke være tabs i samme browser vindue og de må ikke være
                                minimeret.

                            <p>Jeg (Jens Valdez) har selv fået ideen til spillet og lavet alt grafikken og koden.
                                Grafikken er
                                lavet
                                ved
                                brug af ChatGPT og meget af koden er lavet med hjælp fra CoPilot.</p>
                            <p>Alt koden er frit tilgængelig (License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

                                <li>Jeg brainstormede hvad jeg selv synes er sjovt. Det er virkelig sjovt at spille Skov
                                    Stratego.
                                    Her er der
                                    to hold med hver deres holdkaptajn. Spillerne får fysike kort med stratego
                                    karakterer og de
                                    skal
                                    så fange hinanden og prøve at tage det andet holds flag.</li>

                                    tema. Hvad hvis man fløj rundt på en planet og hvad hvis der var et solsystem hvor
                                    planeterne var minimaps og man kunne warp'e mellem dem ved brug af portaler.

                                <p>I need to build a Realtime Multiplayer Strategy game called Space Stratego (like the
                                    board
                                    game) where two teams play against each other. It can be used as a Friday Fun
                                    activity in
                                    companies where two teams can play against each other while each team has a team
                                    call where
                                    strategy can be discussed during the game. It can also be played as a fun reward
                                    activity
                                    after finishing a productive “code-a-game” lesson in a school class or in the Coding
                                    Pirate
                                    Club. The game must be well balanced, with nice graphics and be competitive and fun
                                    to play.
                                    The main aim is to show that one can create cool graphical games that can run
                                    online, e.g.,
                                    using a ChromeBook, using basic programming without using large frameworks like
                                    Unity.</p>

                                <h3>Technology used:</h3>
                                <p>It is implemented in p5js (javascript) and uses the p5party library for handling
                                    multiplayer
                                    functionality.<br>
                                    The code for connecting is:</p>
                                <pre><code>partyConnect("wss://p5js-spaceman-server-29f6636dfb6c.herokuapp.com", "[your-initials-app-name-version]", room);
shared = partyLoadShared("shared", {gameState: "GAME-SETUP",});
me = partyLoadMyShared({playerName: "observer",});
guests = partyLoadGuestShareds();</code></pre>

                                <h3>Programming style:</h3>
                                <p>The code must at all times be kept clean and organized and the logic implemented
                                    using an
                                    object-oriented programming style with the classes
                                    <code>BackgroundStarManager</code>,
                                    <code>BasicMinimap</code>, <code>BlackHole</code>, <code>Canon</code>,
                                    <code>DecorativeStar</code>, <code>Planet</code>, <code>SolarSystem</code>,
                                    <code>Spacecraft</code> and <code>YellowStar</code>.
                                </p>
                                <p>Only the client that is assigned to be the host (by the p5party framework) updates
                                    the shared
                                    variable. Examples of shared data are: <code>gameState</code>,
                                    <code>winningTeam</code>,
                                    <code>characterList</code>, win counters, game timers and <code>cannons</code>.
                                </p>
                                <p>The screen width is 2400 and the screen height 1200. It is divided into these areas:
                                </p>

                                <h4>Game Background Area:</h4>
                                <p>The background is a twinkling star background. When the start screen shows, there are
                                    furthermore 20 randomly located decorative background stars. They can glow and they
                                    can go
                                    supernova. When going supernova, it increases very quickly in size and explodes in a

                                <p>A ring (radius 400) of 20 small images is shown on the left side of the screen. The
                                    small
                                    images show graphics from the game play as well as some generated images of what it
                                    looks
                                    like on the surface of the planets used in the game. In the middle of the ring there
                                    is a
                                    text describing what to do. Under this text, there is a field for entering the
                                    player's
                                    username and two buttons for joining each of the teams (Purple or Green). The small
                                    images
                                    have a size of 120x120. When hovering over a small image, a larger version of that
                                    image
                                    with size 800x800 is shown next to the circle of smaller images and one of the
                                    decorative
                                    background stars glows. When clicking on a smaller image, the glowing decorative
                                    background
                                    star goes supernova. Some of the large images have animations. All this decorative
                                    stuff is
                                    to create atmosphere and to give the game personality.</p>

                                <p>This area is located next to the Character Selection Area and it has the size
                                    1200x700. It
                                    shows a cropped part of an image representing a planet. It is cropped because
                                    screens are
                                    wider than they are high. Here, players move their spacecrafts around within the
                                    boundary of
                                    this cropped circle.</p>

                                    circles. The middle of the circle shows what character a player is, and an outer
                                    ring shows
                                    the team (purple/green) that the player belongs to. Under this minimap, the star
                                    system is
                                    shown. It consists of an orbiting star and black hole as the center, and around the
                                    center
                                    there are 5 orbiting planets of different sizes. The perspective is tilted. When the
                                    planets
                                    orbit the center, they look smaller when they are far away from the observer. The

                                    act as minimaps where the player has an overview of where the other players are. The

                                    are in different locations in their orbits for different players. Sometimes the
                                    planets are
                                    in front of each other and sometimes they are out of sight, so the players have to
                                    inform
                                    each other to get the full picture of where the opponents are.</p>

                                    and the Recon Drone draws against everyone except that it loses to the Engineer. If

                                    <li>If a player wins, then the info message is e.g. “You are a Fleet Admiral (9) and

                                <h4>Warp gate mechanics:</h4>
                                <p>Each planet has an up warp gate and a down warp gate. The location of the warp gates
                                    are
                                    fixed on each planet. When moving into an up warp gate, the player is transferred to
                                    the up
                                    warp gate on the planet with a higher planet index. The up warp gate on the planet
                                    with the
                                    highest planet index transfers the player to the up warp gate of the planet with the
                                    lowest
                                    planet index. Similarly, there is a down warp gate on each planet. Warp gates have a
                                    cooldown of 4 seconds before any warp gates can be used. The warp gates have a
                                    pulsation or
                                    rotation animation. They have no color or movement when they are inactive.</p>

                                <h4>Cannon mechanics:</h4>
                                <p>The planet with index 0 has three hovering cannons. Each of them shoots bullets at
                                    the
                                    nearest player. Data for the hovering cannons and their bullets are stored in the
                                    shared
                                    variable.</p>

                            <p>Functionality: Each of the 5 planets has a fixed "up" and "down" warp gate.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Entering an "up" gate transports the player to the "up" gate on the planet with the
                                    next
                                    highest index (looping from the last planet to the first).</li>
                                <li>Entering a "down" gate transports the player to the "down" gate on the planet with
                                    the next
                                    lowest index (looping from the first planet to the last).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Cooldown: After using any warp gate, a player has a 4-second cooldown before they can use
                                any
                                warp gate again.</p>
                            <p>Visuals: Warp gates have a pulsating/rotating animation when active. They are static and
                                uncolored when on cooldown for a specific player.</p>
                            <h4>5.5. Cannon Mechanics</h4>
                            <p>Location: The planet with index 0 has three hovering cannons.</p>
                            <p>Behavior: Each cannon automatically targets and shoots bullets at the nearest player,
                                regardless
                                of team.</p>
                            <p>Data: Cannon positions, state, and their bullets are stored in the shared object and
                                managed by
                                the host.</p>

                                <p>Jeg startede med at få CoPilot til at implementere fase 1 i todo listen. </p>
                                <p>Jeg brugte denne promt: <a href="spaceStrategoPOC.txt"
                                        target="_blank">spaceStrategoPOC.txt</a>
                                </p>
                                <p>Som med lidt mindre tilretning lavede denne virkende version af spillet: <a
                                        href="https://code-a-game.github.io/spaceStrategoCharacterSelectionAndBattleLogicPOC/index.html?v=1"

                                <p>Herefter tilføjede jeg en feature ad gangen. Efter hver iteration testede jeg at
                                    spillet
                                    virkede hvorefter jeg gemte en kopi af koden så
                                    det var nemt at gå tilbage til en virkende version.</p>

                            Da spillet var færdigt, så committede jeg det til GitHub og udgav det som en GitHub page.
                            Jeg prøvede spillet med mine kollegaer og fik deres feedback således at spillet blev
                            afbalanceret og sjovt at spille i praksis.
                            Spillet kan også bruges f.eks. en skole klasse eller en gruppe børn fra Coding Pirates, så
                            man
                            f.eks. må spille et spil i slutningen af en programmeringstime.

                            </summary>
                            <p>Jeg har installeret en server som alle kan bruge til at lave online spil. Når man
                                opdatere
                                variabler i sit spil, så bliver disse værdier automatisk synkroniseret til de andre
                                browsere der
                                er logget på sammen server. Se i kravsspecifikation hvordan man tilgår serveren.</p>
                            <p>Den nuværende server hedder "p5js-spaceman-server-29f6636dfb6c.herokuapp.com" og man skal
                                huske
                                at opdatere applications navnet så det er pre fixet med forbogstaverne fra sit eget navn
                                samt
                                navnet på applicationen + version således at navnet er entydigt.</p>
                            <p>Serveren håndterer automatisk synkronisering af spiltilstande mellem alle tilsluttede
                                klienter,
                                så alle spillere altid har den nyeste information.</p>
                            <p>Se multiplayer eksemplet her for hvordan man tilslutter sig serveren her: <a href="advancedExamples.html">Avancerede eksempler</a></p>
                            <p>Det er nemt at opsætte sin egen server. Det koster 40 kr pr. måned. Tilgængæld kan
                                tusinde af
                                forskellige applicationer/spil bruge den samme service.</p>
                            <p>Her er en vejledning i hvordan man opsætter sin egen server: <a

                            <p>p5Party har også en server kaldet "demoserver.p5party.org". Jeg har lavet min egen, da
                                der var
                                nogle begrænsinger i forhold til hvor denne server kunne tilgåes fra (Den kunne f.eks.
                                ikke
                                tilgåes fra mit arbejde).</p>

                            <p>Den nuværende implementering af Space Stratego følger ikke best practise. Herudover er
                                der god mulighed for at gøre spillet endnu flottere og sjovere at spille. Prøv at løse
                                følgende opgaver hvis du har mod på en stor udfordring. Det hjælper selvfølgelig at du
                                har et spil der virker som du kan få inspiration fra og at grafikken er lavet:</p>

                                    <p>Undersøg hvad der er best practise med hensyn til at programmere sådan et spil.
                                        Din opgave er at implementere spillet punkt for punkt i to do listen ud fra
                                        beskrivelsen og kravsspecifikationen. Have fokus på at gøre koden så ren, objekt
                                        orienteret og så test bar som mulig. Det vil f.eks. gøre koden nemmere at læse,
                                        teste og vedligeholde hvis hvert område på skærm var implementeret som sin egen
                                        selvstændige komponent/klasse. Herudover vil det gøre program logikken nemmere
                                        at teste hvis program logik og render funktionalitet bliver adskildt. Have fun

                            <p>I have created the following online multiplayer game: <a
                                    href="https://friday-fun.github.io/"
                                    target="_blank">https://friday-fun.github.io/</a></p>

                            <p>After selecting "START NEW GAME," paste the URL into another browser window to start the
                                game.
                                You should then see the screen below. Here you need to enter your name and choose either
                                the green or purple team.</p>

                            <p>You can try the game to get familiar with its functionality. You need multiple players to
                                play it properly.
                                However, you can open the game in two different browser windows and have two players.
                                The two browser windows
                                must not be tabs in the same browser window and they must not be minimized.</p>
                            <p>I (Jens Valdez) came up with the game idea and created all the graphics and code.
                                The graphics were created with ChatGPT, and much of the code was made with help from
                                CoPilot.</p>

                            <p>To come up with the idea for the game, I did the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I brainstormed what I personally find fun. It's really fun to play Forest Stratego.
                                    There are two teams, each with a team captain. Players get physical cards with
                                    Stratego characters,
                                    and they have to catch each other and try to capture the other team's flag.</li>
                                <li>
                                    At my workplace, we work together online from different countries. Every other
                                    Friday,
                                    we have a "Friday Fun" for half an hour where we play online games.</li>
                                </li>
                                <li>I thought it would be fun to create an online version of Forest Stratego with a
                                    space theme.
                                    What if you flew around on a planet, and what if there was a solar system where the
                                    planets were
                                    minimaps and you could warp between them using portals?
                                </li>

                                <p>I need to build a Realtime Multiplayer Strategy game called Space Stratego (like the
                                    board
                                    game) where two teams play against each other. It can be used as a Friday Fun
                                    activity in
                                    companies where two teams can play against each other while each team has a team
                                    call where
                                    strategy can be discussed during the game. It can also be played as a fun reward
                                    activity
                                    after finishing a productive “code-a-game” lesson in a school class or in the Coding
                                    Pirate
                                    Club. The game must be well balanced, with nice graphics and be competitive and fun
                                    to play.
                                    The main aim is to show that one can create cool graphical games that can run
                                    online, e.g.,
                                    using a ChromeBook, using basic programming without using large frameworks like
                                    Unity.</p>

                                <h3>Technology used:</h3>
                                <p>It is implemented in p5js (javascript) and uses the p5party library for handling
                                    multiplayer
                                    functionality.<br>
                                    The code for connecting is:</p>
                                <pre><code>partyConnect("wss://p5js-spaceman-server-29f6636dfb6c.herokuapp.com", "[your-initials-app-name-version]", room);
shared = partyLoadShared("shared", {gameState: "GAME-SETUP",});
me = partyLoadMyShared({playerName: "observer",});
guests = partyLoadGuestShareds();</code></pre>

                                <h3>Programming style:</h3>
                                <p>The code must at all times be kept clean and organized and the logic implemented
                                    using an
                                    object-oriented programming style with the classes
                                    <code>BackgroundStarManager</code>,
                                    <code>BasicMinimap</code>, <code>BlackHole</code>, <code>Canon</code>,
                                    <code>DecorativeStar</code>, <code>Planet</code>, <code>SolarSystem</code>,
                                    <code>Spacecraft</code> and <code>YellowStar</code>.
                                </p>
                                <p>Only the client that is assigned to be the host (by the p5party framework) updates
                                    the shared
                                    variable. Examples of shared data are: <code>gameState</code>,
                                    <code>winningTeam</code>,
                                    <code>characterList</code>, win counters, game timers and <code>cannons</code>.
                                </p>
                                <p>The screen width is 2400 and the screen height 1200. It is divided into these areas:
                                </p>

                                <h4>Game Background Area:</h4>
                                <p>The background is a twinkling star background. When the start screen shows, there are
                                    furthermore 20 randomly located decorative background stars. They can glow and they
                                    can go
                                    supernova. When going supernova, it increases very quickly in size and explodes in a
                                    bright
                                    flash. The animation takes around 2 seconds.</p>

                                <h4>Start Screen Area:</h4>
                                <p>A ring (radius 400) of 20 small images is shown on the left side of the screen. The
                                    small
                                    images show graphics from the game play as well as some generated images of what it
                                    looks
                                    like on the surface of the planets used in the game. In the middle of the ring there
                                    is a
                                    text describing what to do. Under this text, there is a field for entering the
                                    player's
                                    username and two buttons for joining each of the teams (Purple or Green). The small
                                    images
                                    have a size of 120x120. When hovering over a small image, a larger version of that
                                    image
                                    with size 800x800 is shown next to the circle of smaller images and one of the
                                    decorative
                                    background stars glows. When clicking on a smaller image, the glowing decorative
                                    background
                                    star goes supernova. Some of the large images have animations. All this decorative
                                    stuff is
                                    to create atmosphere and to give the game personality.</p>

                                <h4>Character Selection Area:</h4>
                                <p>This area is located on the left-hand side of the screen. Here, 40 Space Stratego

                                    for the team are displayed with their name (space-themed names) and rank in
                                    brackets. The
                                    players on each team can only see the characters for their own team. When a player
                                    has
                                    selected a character, the player's username is displayed next to that character.</p>

                                    1200x700. It
                                    shows a cropped part of an image representing a planet. It is cropped because
                                    screens are
                                    wider than they are high. Here, players move their spacecrafts around within the
                                    boundary of
                                    this cropped circle.</p>

                                <h4>Minimap Area:</h4>
                                <p>A player can toggle between the Game Area and the Minimap Area by pressing the space
                                    button.
                                    It shows the full planets, but as a minimap. Here the characters are represented by
                                    small
                                    circles. The middle of the circle shows what character a player is, and an outer
                                    ring shows
                                    the team (purple/green) that the player belongs to. Under this minimap, the star
                                    system is
                                    shown. It consists of an orbiting star and black hole as the center, and around the
                                    center
                                    there are 5 orbiting planets of different sizes. The perspective is tilted. When the
                                    planets
                                    orbit the center, they look smaller when they are far away from the observer. The
                                    planets
                                    act as minimaps where the player has an overview of where the other players are. The
                                    planets
                                    are in different locations in their orbits for different players. Sometimes the
                                    planets are
                                    in front of each other and sometimes they are out of sight, so the players have to
                                    inform
                                    each other to get the full picture of where the opponents are.</p>

                                    are
                                    fixed on each planet. When moving into an up warp gate, the player is transferred to
                                    the up
                                    warp gate on the planet with a higher planet index. The up warp gate on the planet
                                    with the
                                    highest planet index transfers the player to the up warp gate of the planet with the
                                    lowest
                                    planet index. Similarly, there is a down warp gate on each planet. Warp gates have a
                                    cooldown of 4 seconds before any warp gates can be used. The warp gates have a
                                    pulsation or
                                    rotation animation. They have no color or movement when they are inactive.</p>

                                <h4>Cannon mechanics:</h4>
                                <p>The planet with index 0 has three hovering cannons. Each of them shoots bullets at
                                    the
                                    nearest player. Data for the hovering cannons and their bullets are stored in the
                                    shared
                                    variable.</p>

                                <h4>Graphics:</h4>

                            <p>With some minor adjustments, this created a working version of the game: <a

                                balanced and fun to play in practice.
                                The game can also be used by a school class or a group of children from Coding Pirates,
                                for example, as a reward activity at the end of a programming lesson.</p>

                            </summary>
                            <p>I have installed a server that anyone can use to create online games. When you update
                                variables in your game, these values are automatically synchronized to other browsers
                                that
                                are logged into the same server. See the requirements specification for how to access
                                the server.</p>
                            <p>The current server is called "p5js-spaceman-server-29f6636dfb6c.herokuapp.com" and you
                                need to
                                remember to update the application name so it is prefixed with your own initials plus
                                the application name + version to make the name unique.</p>
                            <p>The server automatically handles synchronization of game states between all connected
                                clients,
                                so all players always have the latest information.</p> 
                            <p>See the multiplayer example here for how to connect to the server here: <a href="advancedExamples.html">Advanced Examples</a></p>
                            <p>It's easy to set up your own server. It costs about $5 per month. In return, thousands of
                                different applications/games can use the same service.</p>
                            <p>Here is a guide on how to set up your own server: <a

                            <p>p5Party also has a server called "demoserver.p5party.org". I created my own since there
                                were
                                some limitations regarding where this server could be accessed from (for example, it
                                couldn't
                                be accessed from my workplace).</p>

                            <p>The current implementation of Space Stratego doesn't follow best practices. There's also
                                a good opportunity to make the game even more visually appealing and fun to play. Try to
                                solve the following tasks if you're up for a big challenge. It helps, of course, that
                                you have a working game to get inspiration from and that the graphics are already
                                created:</p>

                                    <p>Research what are best practices for programming such a game. Your task is to
                                        implement the game point by point from the to-do list based on the description
                                        and requirements specification. Focus on making the code as clean,
                                        object-oriented, and testable as possible. For example, it would make the code
                                        easier to read, test, and maintain if each area of the screen was implemented as
                                        its own independent component/class. Additionally, it would make program logic
                                        easier to test if program logic and rendering functionality were separated. Have
                                        fun!</p>
